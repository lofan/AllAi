A collection of market resources and tools
THE ULTIMATE MARKET INVESTMENT TOOLKIT
Over the years I've amassed a large collection of links, resources, tools and so on that I find useful in my trading/investing activities. I'm compiling those here, along with any that were shared with me via Twitter/Reddit/email/etc and seemed useful after a cursory look. While I've done my best to link to tools that are not only legitimate but also likely to stay active, alive and useful for the foreseeable future, obviously I have no control over these companies/websites and over time some of the links may break or situations may emerge that turn them into poor recommendations. Also, this list is not exhaustive by any means and may be updated in the future as new tools/resources emerge.
DISCLAIMER: In general, there is no preference given to any of these resources and this is not a recommendation to use them. Besides categorizing them and deciding to include some based on personal experience, I am not officially suggesting any opinion on any of these, but I do have experience with many of them and have tried to include things I've had good experiences with or that I personally use in my trading/investing activities.
Any links that are bold are things I either currently use or have used enough in the past to get a good feel for their quality/functionality, but that does not mean I am recommending them, only that I have personal experience with them. If it is not bold, it doesn't mean I've never used it, only that it's something I just use now and then or that it seemed handy at a cursory glance. In short regarding this entire list, I am not a financial advisor. Do your own due diligence and speak to a professional before making any financial decisions.

**DISCLAIMER:** *In general, there is **no preference** given to any of these resources and this is not a recommendation to use them.

Alright, here we go:

*I've categorized brokers into two groups based on the types of clients they cater to. Long-term-focused brokers tend to offer IRAs, 401k's and other types of retirement accounts. Active trading/professional brokers tend to have more advanced software, faster executions, and cater to traders who are more active in the markets. One is not necessarily better, and many people will use both.*

*For books, I bolded the main titles of any I have personally read **and** found to be applicable in a practical sense, or were just really good. In general, all of these are commonly recommended and though some may be a bit dated I still think there are little tidbits within all of them that one may find useful. I'll categorize these and add to the list...eventually...maybe...*

*I've categorized Twitter accounts into two groups. In general, I've tried to restrict this list to only those that are consistently active and sharing quality content*

- ***Individuals/Small Services**: These accounts are more likely to share active trading info, current market opinions, charts, trading ideas and the like, and may run chat rooms/alert/research websites or services.*
- ***Professional/Research-Focused/Journalists/Capital Groups/Funds/HFT**: These accounts tend to have a research/broader-market focus and are more likely to put out short/long theses, research reports, or write articles on major news outlets*
